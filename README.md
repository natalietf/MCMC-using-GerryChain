# MCMC-using-GerryChain

'GerryChain' is a python package created and made available by the [MGGG redistricting lab](https://mggg.org/). The guide to the software, along with several examples of it in use can all be found on their [GitHub repositry](https://github.com/mggg-states). Dr. Daryl Deford has also created some very interesting and useful programs to show how GerryChain works which can be found [here](https://github.com/drdeford).

I have uploaded 3 files to this repository:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** file (.ipynb) which I recommend if you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) installed and are able to install the [GerryChain](https://gerrychain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. This file can be edited if you wish to experiment with different values.
- If you do not have any of these installations I recommend using the **PDF** version (.pdf). This contains the same code and explanations as the Jupyter notebook file, however you will not be able to edit it.
- Finally there is a **Python** file (.py) which I have added to display the full code. It does not contain any of the results and the descriptions however can still be run using anaconda as long as you have all the installations.

Other packages I used for this project included matplotlib, functools, networkx and a random number generator however all of these are included with [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
